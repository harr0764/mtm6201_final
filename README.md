## About the project

In working on this coding assignment, I followed a step-by-step process: planning, coding, and testing. I faced challenges when things got tricky or confusing, like understanding complex ideas or fixing mistakes in my code. To deal with these challenges, I looked up information online, asked friends for help, and practiced until things clicked. Working together with classmates also helped us figure things out. Overall, I learned that persistence pays off in coding, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it.
